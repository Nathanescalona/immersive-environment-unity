Immersive Environment Project
Overview



This project is a first-person, 3D immersive environment designed to replicate a personal living space. It was developed as a final project for the Immersive Environment Design course, combining elements of visual design, 3D modeling, and interactive media. The environment is built entirely from the ground up, incorporating original assets, textures, lighting, and audio.

Objectives



The primary objective of this project was to demonstrate the integration of multiple creative tools and disciplines into a cohesive, interactive experience. It showcases the use of:

3D modeling and texturing for realistic spatial design
Environmental audio design for immersion
Lighting, post-processing, and scripting to enhance atmosphere and interactivity
Features
Custom 3D Assets: Modeled and textured all room elements using Autodesk Maya.
Immersive Audio: Integrated both 2D and 3D audio sources to create spatial soundscapes and environmental depth.
Interactive Components: Implemented basic scripting and collider systems to define player interaction and spatial boundaries.
Optimized Environment: Utilized lighting effects, skybox customization, and post-processing to balance performance with visual fidelity.
Tools and Technologies
Unity – Game engine used for environment assembly and interaction design
Autodesk Maya – 3D modeling and texturing of all original assets
Adobe Photoshop – Texture creation and refinement
Adobe Audition – Sound design, mixing, and implementation of layered audio
C# / Unity Scripting – Basic functionality and triggers
Post-Processing Stack – Color grading, bloom, and depth of field for atmosphere
Development Process



The environment was constructed iteratively, beginning with 3D modeling in Maya before importing assets into Unity. Textures were refined in Photoshop to ensure consistency, and Audition was used to design a layered ambient soundscape. Once assembled, lighting and post-processing effects were added to achieve a cohesive, realistic atmosphere. Attention was paid to collider placement and spatial boundaries to preserve immersion and player flow.

Future Improvements
Expand interactivity through additional scripted objects and animations
Refine texture fidelity and introduce dynamic lighting adjustments
Integrate performance optimization for broader platform compatibility
Add accessibility features such as adjustable movement speed and lighting options
Deliverables
Full Unity build for Windows and MacOS
Zipped project folder containing all source files, textures, and audio assets



Would you like me to make a shorter version of this too — one that fits GitHub’s preview pane nicely (3–4 short sections) and links to the full version in the repo? It helps make your profile look cleaner when recruiters browse it.
