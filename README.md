Immersive Environment Project



A first-person 3D environment inspired by a personal living space, created from the ground up using Unity, Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop, and Audition. This project demonstrates the integration of visual design, spatial audio, and interactivity to produce an immersive digital experience.

Highlights
Original 3D Assets: Modeled and textured all room elements in Maya.
Immersive Audio: Combined 2D soundtrack and 3D spatial sound design.
Environment Design: Implemented lighting, skybox, and post-processing for realism.
Interactivity: Used Unity colliders, triggers, and scripting for player engagement.
Tech Stack



Unity • Autodesk Maya • Photoshop • Audition • C# • Post-Processing Stack

Future Plans



Enhance interactivity, refine textures, and expand functionality for broader compatibility.
